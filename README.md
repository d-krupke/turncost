# Tours with Turn Costs

**The material is currently made camera-ready, i.e., own code is commented, foreign code excluded with proper instruction and CMake-ckecks how to include it for compilation, etc. Unfortunately, a bunch of further deadlines are keeping me busy. After the EuroCG deadline (09. Jan) I should be able to find one or two days to finally finish it (it's all trivial work but it's also quite a lot of code).**

Soon here will be code for an approximated and exact solver for cycle covers and tours with turn costs in grid graphs. Further, additional material such as experimental results and test instances from a freshly submitted paper.
